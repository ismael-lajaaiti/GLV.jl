# GLV.jl

A package for simulating the dynamics of the Generalized Lotka-Volterra (GLV) model in Julia.

## Features

- Customize interaction matrices, growth rates, and carrying capacities.
- Efficient numerical integration using Juliaâ€™s differential equation solvers.

For detailed usage and examples, please refer to the [documentation](https://ismael-lajaaiti.github.io/GLV.jl/).

## TODO

- [ ] Implement functions from the cavity method to predict community properties.
- [ ] Implement species sensitivity to press
- [ ] Implement species sensitivity to extinction
- [ ] Add a dispersion term in the model.
- [ ] Create package logo.
- [ ] Publish the package in the Julia registry.
- [x] Add perturbations functions (noise, extinction, press, pulse).
- [x] Implement species reactivity
